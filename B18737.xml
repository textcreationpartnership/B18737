            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The CASE of <hi>William Warner,</hi> Gent. Relating to his WATER-WORKS at <hi>Deale.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ABout Twelve Months since the said <hi>Warner</hi> being at <hi>Deale,</hi> observed their great want of good Water both for Town and Shipping, and was requested by divers of the Inhabitants to Erect <hi>Water-works</hi> there, but being advised that the Royalty belonged to his Grace the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> would not ingage therein 'till most of the principal Inhabitants certified his Lordship of their want of Water, and Petitioned his Grace to countenance and encourage the said Warner therein.</p>
            <p>Whereupon his Grace recomended a skilful Artist to Survey the Town and Grounds adjacent, and his Lordship being well satisfied with this Surveyer's report, gave <hi>Warner</hi> Leave and Encouragement (in writing under his hand) to begin and proceed in the said undertaking. On which the said <hi>Warner</hi> began and proceeded, in order to Supply the said Town and Shipping with Water, and hath expended and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted for necessaries in this undertaking about Thirteen Hundred Pounds.</p>
            <p>But hath suspended his proceedings at present by reason of the pretenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Mr. <hi>William Rider,</hi> upon a Patent granted by the late King <hi>James</hi> unto <hi>Edward Burdett,</hi> Esq. (a convicted Papist) and to the said <hi>Rider</hi> at <hi>Burdett's</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, as the Patent sets forth, for Watering the said Town, who thereon opposed <hi>Warners</hi> Bill (twice read in the Honourable House of <hi>Commons</hi>) for the purpose aforesaid, and obtained leave to bring in a Bill in his own Name, which <hi>Warner</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses was granted, upon the said <hi>Rider</hi>'s Suggestions in his Printed Case, most of the Allegations of which, <hi>Warner</hi> hopes to prove are Notoriously false.</p>
            <p>And that the Crown had no right to Grant that Patent, the Royalty belonging to the Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> but if any Interest passed thereby, it was in Trust for <hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>Grissin,</hi> who was Attainted and Outlawed for High Treason, and the Interest reverted again to the Crown.</p>
            <p>And whereas the said <hi>Rider</hi> in his Case pretends, that 2500 <hi>l.</hi> was taken up to defray the Charges and Expence of the said Grant and Undertaking, and that Agents were sent down to treat with the Inhabitants of <hi>Deale,</hi> from whom they obtained Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions. The said <hi>Warner</hi> hopes to prove by divers of the principal Inhabitants of the said Town, That no Money was ever laid out by the Patentees, or any Person for them, about the said Water-works, and that no Agents did ever appear to Treat with the said Town, or take Subscriptions on that account save only <hi>Cole</hi> alias <hi>Hall, Robinson</hi> and <hi>Gillibrand,</hi> which three Persons are mentioned in the Tryal of Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> folio 19. and therein declared to be in the Assassinating Plot and sworn to be then at <hi>Deale,</hi> who were there some time under colour of this Patent, but on discovery of that Plot (Search being made for them) these Agents fled, <hi>Cole</hi> alias <hi>Hall,</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> and the others not heard of since at <hi>Deale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Patent hath not been made use of, neither before nor since that Plot, but only at that Juncture of Time, about which time <hi>Rider</hi> the other Patentee also was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Fleet-Prison,</hi> as disaffected to the Government.</p>
            <p>And whereas the said <hi>Rider</hi> in his Case sets forth, that the 2500 <hi>l.</hi> was not applied towards the <hi>Water-works,</hi> by reason of the disagreement of the Parties concern'd. Now considering to and for whom the Patent was granted, who the Agents were (that took the Subscriptions) and the conveniency of <hi>Deale</hi> for Correspondency with <hi>France:</hi> Whether it may not be necessary to enquire who those Parties are that disagreed, and to what use this 2500 <hi>l.</hi> was applied? is Humbly submitted to the Consideration of the Honourable House of <hi>Commons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the said <hi>Warner</hi> having at the Request of the Town of <hi>Deale,</hi> by the Leave and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the Lord of the Royalty, hath contracted for and expended about 1300 <hi>l.</hi> on the aforesaid Undertaking, and having also covenanted to pay considerable Yearly Rents for 99 Years for Grounds convenient, upon which he hath erected Buildings for the Purposes aforesaid. And having no way left to make himself Reparation for the several Summs of Money he hath Expended, and Contracted for about the Premises aforesaid; Humbly hopes that the Honourable House of <hi>Commons</hi> will not pass any Bill to confirm the said Patent, to the Prejudice of the said <hi>Warner</hi>'s Right.</p>
